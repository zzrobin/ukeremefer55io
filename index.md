## Transportation
* A bus will be organized to transport all of you who will be staying at Silver lake
* If anybody has free space in their vehicles for an additional person to take with you would
be also great.



## Accommodation options
* Dear guest, as the wedding will be partly done at our house in Klenje and partly
in the nearest bigger city Požarevac, we have some recommendations for you where you could book your stay.

* If you prefer to take bus organized by us, we recommend to book somewhere on Sliver Lake (Srebrno jezero) 
where the bus will pick you up an drive you the rest of the trip and at the end of the wedding back to
Silver lake. Silver lake is very beautiful location during summer as it is one of the most after sought summer destinations. (If anyone wants to do some sightseeing there are a couple of places you could visit, which are listed at the bottom of the wedding guide) 
This  we would recommend as you can relax with a morning coffee, breakfast and enjoy the lake view.

* Ideal flight from Roma: search at [Skyscanner](https://www.skyscanner.at/transport/fluge/rome/beg/230629/?adults=1&adultsv2=1&cabinclass=economy&children=0&childrenv2=&inboundaltsenabled=false&infants=0&originentityid=27539793&outboundaltsenabled=false&preferdirects=false&ref=home&rtn=0) 
*  Ideal flight from Barcelona: search at [Skyscanner] (https://www.skyscanner.at/transport/fluge/bcn/beg/230629/?adults=1&adultsv2=1&cabinclass=economy&children=0&childrenv2=&destinationentityid=27538720&inboundaltsenabled=false&infants=0&originentityid=27548283&outboundaltsenabled=false&preferdirects=false&ref=home&rtn=0)

### Travel by car from Vienna
* By car, i.e. from Vienna, you have ~700 km of drive
* To travel through Hungary you will need "Vignete" [Info](https://maglit.me/vigneteinfo) 
* *__NOTICE__* : Serbia is not part of EU so you will have to go through border control on the Hungarian-Serbian border and you will need a passport.
* AVOID: Avoid at all cost the border crossing "Horgoš" as it is a death queue during summer [Location]([Location](https://maglit.me/horgosbordercrossing)), this is because it is the main highway border
crossing so a lot of people do not know of other possibilities.
* Better alternatives: [Kelebija/Tompa](https://maglit.me/kelebijabordercrossing), [Bajmok](https://maglit.me/bajmokbordercrossing), [Bački vinogradi](https://maglit.me/bajmokbordercrossing)
* Vienna -> Klenje  (Kelebija/Tompa is set as a border crossing just as an example)
